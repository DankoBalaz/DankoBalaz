- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DankoBalaz, welcome to my crib.
- I am currently learning how to administrate Linux servers (especially deployment of new projects, networking and logging)
- I also try to step up my frontend game
- I make my bread as a contract copywriter for BetterStack and you can see a lot of my work at their community websites. I focus on DevOps topics and tools.
- You can reach me on twitter @dankobalaz
